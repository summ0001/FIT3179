            Sea turtles are ancient marine reptiles that have been navigating the oceans for over 100 million years.
            There
            are seven species of sea turtles, six of which are considered threatened or endangered, primarily due to
            human
            activities such as habitat destruction, pollution, climate change, and illegal hunting. They play a crucial
            role
            in maintaining marine ecosystems, from controlling jellyfish populations to supporting seagrass beds. This
            visualisation explores their anatomy, diet, movement, threats, and conservation efforts.

                    Sea turtles are remarkable marine reptiles with unique adaptations that have allowed them to thrive
                    in the
                    oceans for over 100 million years. Their strong, streamlined shells protect them from predators,
                    while their
                    powerful flippers enable long-distance swimming and precise maneuvering in diverse habitats.
                    Different
                    species display fascinating variations: for example, green turtles are primarily herbivorous,
                    feeding on
                    seagrass and algae, whereas loggerheads favor a diet of crustaceans and mollusks. Understanding
                    these
                    anatomical differences is key to identifying species and studying their ecological roles. The life
                    cycle
                    of sea turtles is equally extraordinary, from hatchlings making perilous journeys from nest to sea,
                    to adults
                    navigating vast ocean currents to reach feeding and nesting grounds. By exploring their anatomy,
                    diet, and
                    lifecycle, we gain insight into their survival strategies and the challenges they face, which is
                    essential
                    for effective conservation planning.

        <h2>2. Nesting & Migration</h2>

        <div class="grid grid-nesting-map">
            <div class="grid-item">
                <p>Marine turtles undertake some of the longest migrations in the animal kingdom, traveling hundreds or
                    even
                    thousands of kilometers between their feeding grounds and nesting beaches. These journeys are guided
                    by
                    remarkable natural navigational abilities, including sensing ocean currents, magnetic fields, and
                    environmental cues. Female turtles often return to the very beaches where they were born to lay
                    their eggs,
                    a phenomenon known as natal homing. Timing is critical, nesting occurs during specific seasons to
                    maximise
                    hatchling survival, and hatchlings instinctively make their way from the nest to the ocean,
                    beginning their
                    first migration. Understanding these patterns of movement and nesting behavior is essential to
                    appreciating
                    the life cycle of marine turtles.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to these long migrations, different turtle species have distinct nesting and hatching
                    schedules
                    that are closely tied to regional environmental conditions. Some species nest year-round in tropical
                    areas,
                    while others have highly seasonal nesting periods. Protecting these critical nesting beaches and
                    ensuring
                    safe passage for hatchlings is essential, as even small disturbances can significantly affect
                    survival rates.
                    By studying these migration and nesting patterns, scientists can better understand population
                    dynamics and
                    implement effective conservation strategies to safeguard these ancient marine travelers.

        <h3 class="subheading">Predators and Human Threats</h3>
        <div class="grid">
            <div class="grid-item">
                <p>Despite their incredible adaptations and long evolutionary history, sea turtles face a wide array of threats
                    that jeopardise their survival. Natural predators such as sharks and large birds prey on eggs, hatchlings,
                    and occasionally adults. Yet the greatest dangers stem from human activity — coastal development reduces
                    nesting habitat, pollution and plastic waste cause entanglement or ingestion, and bycatch in fishing gear
                    leads to countless accidental deaths. Climate change adds further stress by altering ocean currents, raising
                    sea levels, and changing sand temperatures at nesting sites, which can affect hatchling sex ratios.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While these challenges are severe, coordinated conservation efforts offer hope. International protection
                    laws, community-based beach patrols, and improved fishing practices have all contributed to stabilising some
                    populations. Continued research into migration patterns, habitat use, and climate resilience helps refine
                    conservation strategies. Educating local communities and promoting sustainable tourism can also foster
                    coexistence, ensuring these ancient mariners continue to thrive in the world’s oceans.

                <p>Sea turtles are increasingly affected by a variety of human-induced threats that compromise their
                    survival.
                    Climate change is one of the most pressing issues: rising ocean temperatures not only alter turtle
                    migration patterns but also damage critical habitats like coral reefs and seagrass beds, which serve
                    as
                    feeding and nesting grounds. Bleaching events caused by warmer waters destroy coral ecosystems,
                    while
                    rising sea levels can inundate nesting beaches. Pollution is another major factor—turtles often
                    mistake
                    plastic debris, fishing nets, and other waste for food, leading to ingestion, entanglement, or
                    internal
                    injuries that can be fatal. Chemical pollutants, such as pesticides and heavy metals, accumulate in
                    marine
                    food webs, further affecting turtle health. Other human activities, like coastal development and
                    bycatch
                    in fishing gear, exacerbate these challenges. Understanding these interconnected threats is vital
                    for
                    designing effective conservation strategies, including habitat restoration, pollution reduction, and
                    climate mitigation, to ensure the long-term survival of sea turtles."
